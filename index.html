      <h2 id="toggleTitle"> Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchy</h2> 
        <div id="moreInfo" class="hidden">
          <p>
            The Dobkin-Kirkpatric (DK) hierarchy for 3D collision detection is a hierarchical 
            structure that allows a polyhedron to be efficiently represented to answer intersection 
            queries. It is constructed from a polyhedron P in 3D space by successively 
            removing vertices, producing a series of nested polyhedra of decreasing complexity, 
            which facilitates collision detection tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DK hierarchy is constructed as a sequence of polyhedra P1, P2, …, Pk, where each 
            polyhedron Pi +1 is contained in Pi, where P1 = P and the last polyhedron Pk is a 
            tetrahedron. At each step, the removed vertices form an independent set in the structure, 
            which means that the removed vertices are not connected to each other, which guarantees a 
            balanced removal. The height of the hierarchy is O(log n), where n is the number of vertices 
            in P. This is due to the fact that we remove a significant fraction of vertices at each step, 
            allowing fast queries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each polyhedron in the hierarchy maintains a set of vertices that defines its convexity and 
            allows its size to be reduced at each level, guaranteeing that the combinatorial complexity 
            of each level remains O(n), where n is the initial complexity of the polyhedron. In addition, 
            the structure allows for fast separation queries at each level of the hierarchy, which is critical 
            for determining whether two polyhedra collide.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine whether two 3D processed polyhedra P and Q intersect, we start by constructing 
            the DK hierarchies of P and Q, which allows us to reduce spatial complexity and ensure an 
            efficient query. During a query, the algorithm recursively compares the hierarchy levels of 
            both polyhedra, starting with the complete polyhedron and moving down towards lower complexity 
            levels. Invariants are maintained to ensure that at each step one of the polyhedra grows while 
            the other shrinks, facilitating the identification of a separation plane or intersection point. 
            This approach allows the intersection test to be performed in O(log |P| + log |Q|) time, significantly 
            improving previous times and establishing optimal performance for this type of query.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DK hierarchy has also been extended to test intersections in higher dimensional spaces, for which 
            hierarchies based on ε-nets are constructed, allowing the same efficient vertex reduction scheme and 
            logarithmic queries to be maintained. Higher dimensional construction and storage requires a space of 
            O(n ^⌊d/2⌋+ϵ) for any ϵ>0, which optimises storage without losing query efficiency.
          </p>
        <h3 id="toggleBounded"> Bounded version</h3>
          <div id="boundedInfo" class="hidden">
          <p>
            The bounded version of the Dobkin-Kirkpatric hierarchy is a modification of the original hierarchy 
            that attempts to bound the degree of each vertex in the polyhedra at each level of the hierarchy. 
            The relevance of limiting the degree comes from the fact that in certain cases the standard DK hierarchy 
            can result in vertices with high degrees, which can make some query operations difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the standard DK hierarchy, removing vertices to reduce the complexity of the polyhedron at each level 
            can result in vertices with high degrees, which means that some vertices in the DK hierarchy may have a 
            number of neighbours proportional to n, which is inefficient for collision detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bounded hierarchy introduces a constant parameter c which limits the maximum degree of vertices at 
            each level of the hierarchy. It starts with the polyhedron P at the top level of the hierarchy and selects 
            a set of independent vertices to be removed to form the next level of the hierarchy. If a vertex at any level 
            has a degree greater than the boundary c, a partition is performed on the neighbours of that vertex, splitting 
            its edges with new vertices until the vertex's degree falls within the boundary, which involves adding additional 
            vertices that split the incoming edges into high degree vertices. Once the vertex degrees have been set, the 
            convex hull of the resulting set of vertices is taken to build the next level of the hierarchy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the BDK hierarchy, except for the initial polyhedron P, all polyhedra in the hierarchy have a maximum 
            degree of c, where c is a fixed constant, and like the original DK hierarchy, it has a depth of O(log n), 
            which guarantees efficient queries, and the vertices removed at each level form independent sets, ensuring 
            a significant reduction at each step.
          </p>
          <p>
            By limiting the degree of the vertices, it is guaranteed that any search or test operation on the neighbours 
            of a vertex is performed in constant O(1) time, since the number of neighbours is bounded by c. Each level of 
            the hierarchy reduces by an approximately constant fraction of vertices, allowing the query process to maintain 
            O(log^2 n) complexity in the standard hierarchy and to optimise to O(log n) when using the dual polar transformation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="toggleCollision"> Collision detection algorithm in O(log^2 n)</h3>
          <div id="collisionInfo" class="hidden">
          <p>
            Organising the data into hierarchical levels allows the number of vertices to be significantly reduced as the hierarchy 
            descends, making queries efficient and allowing the overall complexity to be O(log^2 n).
          </p>
          <p>
            Each level of comparison between the DK hierarchies of P and Q takes O(log n) time to check whether there is a plane of 
            separation or whether the two polyhedra intersect at that level. Since there are O(log n) levels in each hierarchy, the 
            total time to perform the check is O(log n * log n) = O(log^2 n).
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity O(log^2 n) is the result of the combination of the logarithmic structure of the DK hierarchy, 
            which allows the problem to be reduced to smaller sub-problems at each level, and the efficient intersection 
            search at each level, which is performed in O(log n) due to the limited number of vertices at each level.

      <h2 id="togglePolarDual"> 3D Polar Dual</h2>
        <div id="polarDualInfo" class="hidden">
          <p>
            The polar transformation converts points into planes and vice versa, allowing the geometric properties of 
            polyhedra to be analysed in a dual space that facilitates complex operations such as collision detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a three-dimensional space, given a point x in R^3, its polar is a plane defined as ρ(x)={y∈R3: ⟨x,y⟩=1}, 
            where ⟨∗,∗⟩ is the inner product of Euclidean spaces, meaning that each point x is associated with a plane in 
            the dual space, and likewise each plane in the original space corresponds to a point in the dual space.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a convex polyhedron P in R^3, two possible polarisations are defined. One is ρ0(P), which represents 
            the set of all polar planes of the vertices of P and forms a new polyhedron containing the origin; and the 
            other is ρ∞(P), which is used when the polyhedron does not contain the origin and its dualisation is based 
            on planes in the space outside P. The resulting polar polyhedron ρ0(P) has a dual structure, since the faces 
            of one polyhedron correspond to the vertices of another and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 3D polar transformation provides several useful results. If a point x is inside a polyhedron P, 
            then the polar plane ρ(x) separates the dual polyhedron ρ0(P) in dual space. When two polyhedra P and 
            Q intersect in the original space, their respective duals ρ0(P) and ρ∞(Q) retain properties that make 
            it easy to identify their intersection or separation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The polar transformation is the key to the intersection algorithm of the DK hierarchy. The dualisation 
            transforms the intersection problem of polyhedra in the original space into a separation problem in the 
            dual space. As it traverses the hierarchy of dual polyhedra, the algorithm alternates between the original 
            space and the dual space, evaluating the existence of separation planes or intersection points.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 3D intersection detection, the dual polar transformation allows a simplified representation of the 
            polyhedra to be used, facilitating the identification of intersections by separation planes in dual space.
          </p>
        <h3 id="togglePolarAlgo"> O(log n) Polar Dual algorithm for 3D</h3>
          <div id="polarAlgoInfo" class="hidden">
          <p>
            To obtain an algorithm that achieves O(log n) complexity for detecting collisions between polyhedra in 3D, 
            we rely on the combination of the Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchy with polar dualisation, which allows us to 
            simplify and optimise the intersection query process.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each 3D polyhedron P and Q, we construct its dual polar transformation, which involves obtaining the 
            polyhedra ρ (P) and ρ∞ (P), and ρ (Q) and ρ∞ (Q) in dual space, where faces of a polyhedron correspond 
            to vertices in its dual and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hierarchies DK are created for P and its dual ρ0(P) and also for Q and its dual ρ0(Q). The DK hierarchy 
            allows to organise the polyhedra in a layered structure, where each layer gradually reduces the complexity 
            (number of vertices) by O(log n), which facilitates a fast query.
          </p>
          <p>
            To detect whether P and Q intersect, one starts at the highest level of the DK hierarchies of P and Q, 
            where the complete polyhedra are first tested. At each step of the algorithm, one alternates between the 
            primal space (original space of P and Q) and the dual space (ρ0(P) and ρ∞(Q)), maintaining either a separation 
            invariant or an intersection invariant, which allows to discard at each level a significant part of the polyhedra, 
            either by a separation plane or by confirming the intersection.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the invariants that we maintain during the algorithm, we have the separation invariant, which ensures 
            that there is a plane separating the planes P and ρ0(Q), or vice versa, which is computed in constant time and 
            allows us to proceed to the next level of the hierarchy. On the other hand, we have the intersection invariant, 
            which guarantees that the polyhedra intersect in the original space if it finds an intersection in a plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm achieves O(log n) in query time because each level of the DK hierarchy allows to reduce 
            the combinatorial complexity of the polyhedra and there are only O(log n) levels. At each level, the 
            intersection and separation test operations between the polyhedra or their duals can be performed in 
            constant time due to the simplification of the polyhedra at the lower levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of polar duality and DK hierarchies allows the algorithm to achieve an optimal complexity 
            of (O(log n)) in the intersection query of two 3D polyhedra. The key is to alternate between the 
            original and dual space at each level of the hierarchy, using separation invariants and hierarchical 
            simplification to discard parts of the polyhedra at each step.
